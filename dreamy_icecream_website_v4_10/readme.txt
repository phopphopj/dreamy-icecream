create table if not exists public.reviews (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  name text,
  stars int not null check (stars between 1 and 5),
  text text not null,
  created_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

alter table public.reviews enable row level security;

create policy "public can read reviews"
on public.reviews for select
to anon
using (true);

create policy "public can insert reviews"
on public.reviews for insert
to anon
with check (true);

3) go to project settings -> api
copy:
- project url
- anon public key

4) open index.html and paste into:
const SUPABASE_URL = ""
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = ""

deploy to netlify and reviews will be shared across everyone.
